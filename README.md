# physics_playground
Experiments, simulations, and tiny tools built while learning physics and code.


A growing collection of small simulations, visual experiments, and computational toys
built while learning physics and Python.

## Sections

### Live Patterns
Animated surface waves created from different functions f(x, y, t).

### Vector_Fields
Visualizing flow, direction, and field behavior using quiver plots.

### Contours
Exploring contour slices and level curves of interesting functions.

### imaginefunctions_3D(static)
Visualizing multivariable(plottable) functions using python.

### coolfunctions.txt
can find cool funtions that each open a doorway to real physics
