1. 2D Standing Wave (Helmholtz solution)

z(x,y) = sin(x)cos(y)

From the Helmholtz equation. Models standing waves on membranes, optics, acoustics.

⸻

2. Gaussian Wave Packet (quantum mechanics classic)

z(x,y) = (e^{-(x^2+y^2)})*cos(5sqrt{x^2+y^2})

Localized wave packet, like a ripple that fades. Echoes solutions to the Schrödinger equation.

⸻

3. 2D Interference from Two Sources

z(x,y) = sin(sqrt{(x - 2)^2+ y^2 })+sin(sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + y^2})

Two point sources radiating waves. Classic ripple interference from wave optics and acoustics.

4. Saddle Surface (electrostatics potential vibe)

z(x,y) = x^2 - y^2

A harmonic function, satisfies Laplace’s equation from Laplace’s equation.

⸻

5. Ripple Tank / Circular Waves

z(x,y)=sin(sqrt{x^2+y^2})

Looks like dropping a pebble in a pond. Pure wave propagation symmetry.

⸻

6. Mexican Hat / Ricker Wavelet (field theory, signal processing)

z(x,y)= ( 1 -(x^2 + y^2) )e^{-(x^2+y^2)}

Appears in wavelets, optics, and field distributions.

⸻

7. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Density (2D flavor)

z(x,y) = e^{-(x^2+y^2)}(x^2 + y^2)

Resembles probability densities from the Quantum harmonic oscillator.

⸻

8. Magnetic Dipole Potential Lookalike

z(x,y) = x/{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}

Field pattern vibes from electromagnetism.
  


each one of these equations opens a doorway into real physics . ENJOY
